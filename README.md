# Runner-Game
A runner game that I created in my free time during school with python and pygame. I was mostly 
looking to experiment with mask collison and fluid character movement, and it allowed me to test
out code for buttons, sliders, and highlighting selections with a external cursor. I was also 
experimenting with a different way to control program exiting, and I found that it was not very
efficent at times.

because I used this more as an experiment and testing platform, it is not very polished and there
are issues with the game mechanics and apperence.

none of the art, music or font is mine.
